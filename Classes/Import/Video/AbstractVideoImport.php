     *  An array with an entry 'video' that contains video link OR video id OR video link
     *  and additionally in the same array an entry 'pid' which contains the pid. The pid
     *  is not mandatory!

     * e.g.

     *     4 => ['pid' => 3, 'video' => 'exi0iht_kLw'],
     *     5 => ['pid' => 3, 'video' => 'yt_Vfw1pAmLlY'],

     * @param int $pid this will be the pid of NEW records
     * @param string $recordUids reference that includes all UIDs as a comma separated list
     * @param bool $checkExistingVideos if true the video id in combination with the pid will be checked and no
     *                                  new record will be created if a record with the same video id already exists.
     *                                  Existing videos will be added to $recordUids too!
     * @return array the data array for DataHandler. This is a reference so it will be modified and can be used
     *               after method call.
